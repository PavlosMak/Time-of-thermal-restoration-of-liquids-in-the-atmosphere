# Time-of-thermal-restoration-of-liquids-in-the-atmosphere-
The code of an organ created to measure how much time different liquids need to balance their temperature with the temperature of the air




The organ consisted of an arduino microcontroller and two temperature sensors (DS18B20), one of which was waterproof to monitor the liquid's temperature, connected to the 2 and 3 digital pins on the arduino board.
